This directory contains custom snippets that will likely conflict with those provided by snipMate.vim
Simply append a description after the trigger text as shown below.

From the vim :help multi_snips: 

To specify that a snippet can have multiple matches in a *.snippets file, use
this syntax:

 snippet trigger A description of snippet #1
        expand this text
 snippet trigger A description of snippet #2
        expand THIS text!
